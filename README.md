# London Bike Sharing Data Analysis & Visualization
This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of the London Bike Sharing dataset, leveraging Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data cleaning and analysis, and Tableau for interactive visualizations. The aim is to uncover trends, usage patterns, and insights impacting bike rentals in London.

Project Structure
Data Source: [London Bike Sharing dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset)

Jupyter Notebook: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis.

Tableau Dashboard: Interactive visualizations, including time trends, weather impact, and summary statistics.

Aim:
The aim of the London bike-sharing project is to analyze and visualize bike usage patterns in London using data from the London Bike Sharing dataset. This includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis in Python (Jupyter Notebook), and creating interactive Tableau dashboards to uncover what factors influence bike demand.

Key Insights:

Temporal trends: Clear patterns in bike usage were observed across hours, days, and seasons, revealing peak times and fluctuations in demand.

Weather impact: Variables like temperature, humidity, and wind speed were found to significantly affect the number of bike rentals.

Demand drivers: Both time-of-day and specific weather conditions emerged as major drivers for bike usage, providing actionable information for optimizing bike-sharing operations.

Visualization: Tableau dashboards illustrated these trends, allowing interactive exploration of how bike-sharing evolves over time and under different conditions.

These insights are useful for city planners and bike-sharing companies to improve resource allocation, enhance service efficiency, and better meet user needs.
